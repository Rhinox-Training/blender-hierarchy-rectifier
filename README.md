# blender-hierarchy-rectifier

This is the python script of the addin that will convert the collection hierarchy into the same hierarchy but using empty objects instead.
This is because collections is a blender exclusive thing and it does not get saved inside the .fbx file.
Empty objects do get saved inside the .fbx file, making it possible to retain the hierarchy when using it inside Unity.
